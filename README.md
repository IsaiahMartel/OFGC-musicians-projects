## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

[Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) is the open-source mobile app development framework that makes it easy to
build top quality native and progressive web apps with web technologies.

Ionic Framework is based on [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) and comes with many significant performance, usability, and feature improvements over the past versions.

### Earlier Versions

The source code for earlier versions of the Ionic Framework may exist in other repositories. Please open issues and pull requests in their respective repositories.

* **Ionic 2/3**: Moved to [`ionic-team/ionic-v3`](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-v3)
* **Ionic 1**: Moved to [`ionic-team/ionic-v1`](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-v1)

## Before instalation

Before you start you need:
* Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* MySQL - https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
* Node.js - https://nodejs.org/es/download/.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/IsaiahMartel/AuditorioIonicLaravel
```
##### Backend

Switch to the backend

```
cd AuditorioIonicLaravel/backend/
```
Install all the dependencies using composer
```
composer install
```
Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file 
```
cp .env.example .env
```
Generate a new application key
```
php artisan key:generate
```

Run the database migrations (Set the database connection in .env before migrating)

```
php artisan migrate
```

Start the local development server
```
php artisan serve
```

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

TL;DR command list

```
git clone https://github.com/pablopuch/OFGC.git
cd OFGC/backend/
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

### Data base
We also uploaded the database that was used to test the application, you can check it in "AuditorioIonicLaravel/database-example".

If you want to add your own information, the tables that have effect on the frontend are: Seasons, Projects, Rooms, Schedules, TypeSchedules, Directors, DirectorsProjects, Soloists, Soloists-projects, Composers, Works and Playlists.

##### Frontend

Switch to frontend
```
cd OFGC/fronted/
```

Install all the dependencies using npm
```
npm install
```

Start the local development server

```
ionic serve -l
```
(http://localhost:8200/ is often bugged, switch to http://localhost:8100/ open developer tools and use select a mobile resolution in "Toggle device toolbar")

Now the app is running!!

Our teacher Tiburcio over-helped everyone through the project: https://github.com/tcrurav, and his example of Ionic-Spring was very useful for my first CRUD (https://github.com/tcrurav/spring_ionic_21_22).

Many videos of Develoteca's channel helped me for understanding laravel and creating the backend. Like this, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DU7WLZeam8.

This tutorial on how to create a CRUD in Ionic: https://remotestack.io/ionic-http-requests-with-httpclient-get-post-put-delete-tutorial/.

To create this README and documentation I was colsuting the README of one class-mate, Ruben Banez: https://github.com/rubensantibanezacosta/Ocio_Open/blob/main/README.md and this guide: https://gist.github.com/vinkla/dca76249ba6b73c5dd66a4e986df4c8d.
